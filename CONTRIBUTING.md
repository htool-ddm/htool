## Submitting changes (Pull Requests)

To learn how to submit a pull request, please refer to GitHub’s  
[pull request documentation](https://docs.github.com/fr/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Before your pull request can be merged into `main`:

1. **Tests must run successfully.**
2. **Code style and formatting must follow project standards.**

Instructions for running tests locally and applying formatting can be found in the  
[Htool developer guide](https://htool-ddm.pages.math.cnrs.fr/cpp_api/developer_guide.html#developer-guide).

## Code Style and Guidelines

- Follow the project’s formatting rules (see [developer guide](https://htool-ddm.pages.math.cnrs.fr/cpp_api/developer_guide.html#formatting)).
- Write clear commit messages.
- Keep pull requests focused and reasonably small.
